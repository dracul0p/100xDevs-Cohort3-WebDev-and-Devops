Why Git?

Free
Open source
Scalable
Super Fast
Cheap branching and merging


What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories.
You can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.


Local Repository ------------------->
The Git repository stored on your own computer.

Created using git init or cloned with git clone.

All commits first go to the local repo before going online


Push ------------------------------>

Sends your local commits to a remote repository (GitHub).

Command: git push origin main.

Used to upload your changes for others to see


Pull ------------------------------->
Downloads the latest changes from remote to local.
Also merges those changes into your branch.
Command: git pull origin main.


Basic workflow of Git ---------------->
Step 1 − You modify a file from the working directory.
Step 2 − You add these files to the staging area.
Step 3 − You perform commit operation that moves the files from the staging area. After push operation, it stores the changes permanently to the Git repository

Blob (Binary Large Object) --------->

Blob stores only file content, not filename or folder info.

Each blob has a unique SHA-1 hash.

Git reuses the same blob if the file content doesn’t change.

Tree ---------------------->

Tree represents a directory in Git.

It stores filenames, permissions, and pointers to blobs/other trees.

A commit points to a root tree to represent the whole project snapshot.

Here are **very short 2–3 line notes** on **Commit**:

---

Commit --------------->

A commit is a snapshot of your changes in the repository.

It has a unique SHA-1 hash and a message describing the change.

Stored only in the local repo until you push it to GitHub.

commit obj  think a node of ll .
every coming has a pointer to parent commmit obj


Git Basic Commands (Short Notes) ----------------------------->

git init → Creates a new local repository.

git clone URL → Copies a remote repo to your computer.

git status → Shows changes and current branch state.

git add . → Moves changes to staging area.

git commit -m "msg" → Saves a snapshot of staged changes.

git push → Uploads commits to remote (GitHub).

git pull → Downloads + merges latest changes from remote  to local

git diff → Shows differences in files before committing.

git log → Shows commit history.


//windows git bash
git config --global user.name "Asheesh Rawat"

git config --global user.email "asheeshrawat48@gmail.com"

go to the previous directory
cd -


git init

ls -la 

git status
all untracked files red color
tracked staged file green
 
git add .   stage all untracked file
git commit  add screens shot of staged file

$ git commit -ma    short cut add and commit only wroks for existing file change not for new file
